# PrimeDetector8bit_VERILOG
This is an implementation of 8 bit prime number detector in VERILOG-HDL for Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA. This uses the concept of state machine from Theory of Automata (Deterministic Finite Automata) to determine prime number within &lt;=8 cpu cycles which is a pretty fast implementation using the concept of prime numbers that a number is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than square root of that prime. So we check for division by primes under 15 (&lt; sq.rt of 255) using their state machines.
